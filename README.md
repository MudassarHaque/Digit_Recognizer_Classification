# Digit_Recognizer_Classification
This is a just a motivational project created on 17/9/18 inspired by Andrew Ng. Uploaded this project because those who are persuing Andrew Ng course must be curious to see Logistic Regression working on their own given set of image examples.

# What does it do?
It takes your images stored in folder classifiers as an examples and makes predictions on your own given images, you can even put whole  different images to train, like classifying between spoon and car :p.

# Hope this little thing motivates you.
